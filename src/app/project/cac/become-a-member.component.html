        <h3>What is a Community Advisory Committee?</h3>
        <p>The Community Advisory Committee is a way for interested members of the public to actively participate in and stay informed about an environmental assessment by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>learning more about a proposed project;</li>
            <li>staying up to date on the progress of the environmental assessment; and</li>
            <li>being informed of opportunities to provide their input and advice during the public comment periods and other engagement activities.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Feedback from Community Advisory Committee members contributes to a better understanding of the potential effects of the proposed project on the community. The Environmental Assessment Office forms and operates Community Advisory Committees digitally through EPIC.</p>

      <section class="m-b-0">
        <h3>What can I expect as a Community Advisory Committee Member?</h3>
        <p>The Environmental Assessment Office will provide subscribed Community Advisory Committee members information on the environmental assessment process and the proposed project, including notifications of process milestones, when and where key documents are posted, information on public comment periods and any other engagement opportunities. Members will be invited to provide their input through the public comment periods held throughout the environmental assessment. See the <strong>Community Advisory Committee Guideline</strong> and the <strong>Community Advisory Committee Terms of Reference</strong> for further information.</p>
